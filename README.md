# When Will My Lights Turn Back On?

## Description: DSC80 Final Project

### Introduction 

Our [dataset](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages) contains major power outage data in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. The focus is on understanding how power outage duration varies with specific factors, such as weather conditions, time of year, population density, location, and more. This dataset provides key information to understanding the patterns that can help minimize the impact of future outages.

The dataset contains many variables across 1534 rows. Key columns relevant to our question include:

- OUTAGE.DURATION: Duration of outages in minutes.
- OUTAGE.START.DATE: Day of the year when outage began.
- OUTAGE.START.TIME: Time of day when outage began. 
- OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE: Day of the year when outage was restored.
- OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME: Time of day when outage was restored.
- TOTAL.CUSTOMERS: Annual number of total customers served in the U.S. 
- MONTH: Month when outage occurred.
- CAUSE.CATEGORY: General causes (e.g., weather, equipment failure).
- CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL: Detailed description of the event that caused the outage. 
- UTIL.CONTRI: Utility industry’s contribution to the total GSP in the state (in %). 
- CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: Number of customers impacted.
- U.S._STATE: State in the continental U.S.
- ANOMALY.LEVEL: The oceanic El Niño/La Niña (ONI) index referring to the cold and warm episodes by season.
